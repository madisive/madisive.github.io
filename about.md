## My time in the Club Penguin community
I joined the MMO game Club Penguin in 2006. From 2009 to 2016, I was active in the world of Club Penguin cheats and private servers. I moderated a few and opened my own popular CPPS in 2012 and 2015. A small team and I later created CPSL, a server listing website for the community.

Hi I'm Madi! I live in Indiana, USA. Here I blog about what's important to me.

In my free time I also enjoy gaming and music mixing. I'm a hobbyist software developer.

### My blog
This blog is mostly just for fun. It may contain both lighthearted and serious content, with posts ranging from rants to reviews to my personal opinions. Check it out :)

### YouTube channel
I love to make music, remixes, mashups, and other videos. Check out my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@madi2176).

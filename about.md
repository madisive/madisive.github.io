### Club Penguin â€” former Disney MMO, 2005-2017
I joined Club Penguin in 2006. From 2009 to 2016, I was active in the world of Club Penguin cheats and private servers. I moderated a few servers and opened my own popular one in 2012 and 2015. A small team and I later created CPSL, a server listing website for the community.

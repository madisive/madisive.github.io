Hi I'm Madi! I live in Indiana, USA. I blog about what's important to me here. I also enjoy gaming and music mixing in my free time. I'm a hobbyist developer.

This blog is mostly just for fun. It may contain both lighthearted and serious content, with posts ranging from rants to reviews to my personal opinions. Check it out :D

title: Crafting the Perfect Itinerary for Walt Disney World at Christmas Time
---

It's been over a decade since I last visited Walt Disney World. We had been a total of 3 or 4 times in my life â€” the first when I was around 3 years old, the second when I was 6, and the last when I was 14. Since that last vacation to the most magical place on Earth, I have graduated high school and university, moved out of my parents' home, and gotten married. 

A resurgence in my nostalgia for these childhood vacations, along with my hubby's willingness to experience the parks for the first time, meant that I recently decided I would be going back to WDW this year. This time, I am aiming to make it extraordinary, maybe superior to any of the vacations I had taken as a child, although I won't count on it being a complete success when we finally hit the parks in December.

In making the schedule, I had to set my desire to do absolutely everything aside, meticulously research ride wait times and walking distances, and take into account issues such as recent overcrowding in the parks and dining reservations that are seemingly impossible to get.

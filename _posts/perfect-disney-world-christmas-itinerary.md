title: Crafting the Perfect Itinerary for Walt Disney World at Christmas Time
---

It's been over a decade since I last visited Walt Disney World. I have been a total of three or four times in my life â€” the first when I was around three, the second when I was six, and the last when I was fourteen. Since that last vacation to the most magical place on Earth, I have graduated high school and university, moved out of my parents' home, and gotten married. 

A resurgence in my nostalgia for those childhood vacations meant that I recently decided I would be returning to WDW this year. This time, I'm crafting an extraordinary trip, superior to any of the vacations I took as a child, even if crowd levels mean it won't be a complete success when we finally hit the parks in December.

While creating our itinerary, I had to set my desire to do absolutely everything aside. I meticulously researched ride wait times and walking distances. I took into account issues such as recent overcrowding in the parks and competitive dining reservations.

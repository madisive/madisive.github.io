title: The new animation effects in Windows 11 are terrible
---

Microsoft has dropped the ball on UI animations in Windows 11. Not only are these visually unappealing in some areas of the operating system (I'm looking at you, Task Manager), but the inconsistent and often slow attack times on the animations give the illusion of input lag or low FPS on some machines. This creates a user experience that just feels more unresponsive.

The issue is especially apparent in sluggish context menus in Windows Explorer and other apps. Compare snappiness of visual feedback when hovering the mouse cursor over right-click options with **animations turned on** (left) vs. **animations turned off** (right).

Turn them off by heading to **Start > search 'Animation' > Animation effects**.
